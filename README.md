<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



The pacmen factory exercise is a javascript based game aimed at improving my skills on javascript in general. In this exercise you would find out that the use of very important javascript concepts were implemented.  In this program arrays, callback functions, functions, event handlers concepts were all treated but most importantly the concept of dynamically creating elements and the concvept of a virtual DOM was introduced and used to run this program.W

Here's the highlight:
* Call back functions
* Event handlers
* Funtions were created and triggered at click.
* Virtual DOM
* Arrays
* Creating Elements dynamically
